# College_Searcher 

AIM: To develop a website displaying sorted college sorted and filtered by college preferences  and one’s percentile score.


For a science student aiming at engineering, at the time of counselling, it becomes difficult for one to select an engineering college and branch according to one’s percentile score in an exam like Joint Entrance Exam(JEE) or Maharashtra Common Entrance Test (MHT CET). 

A lot of time is consumed when we need to check every college website or search the college name in document containing percentile cutoffs of a round

This project intends to address this issue by searching and sorting data according to one’s percentile and college preference

This data was extracted to csv using regular expressions (regex) from a pdf of the State Common Entrance Test Cell's Cut Off List of All India Seats CAP Round I for the academic year 2021-22.

Technology used: 

Python libraries pdfplumber, re, pandas, namedtuple
Regular expressions (Regex)
Django python framework
Sqlite database 
HTML, CSS
Jupyter Notebook
